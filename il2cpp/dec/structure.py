        """Prove the program's throw helpers once, from the whole binary.

        Fix 90 made helper naming per-method, which is honest but narrow:
        a method with no EH pad of its own can never name a helper, so
        throw renderings collapsed and bare helper calls took their place.
        Over a fixed 400-method sample, counted with identical needles in
        both configurations, this set restores 11 -> 17 throw renderings and
        takes residual calls to the proven helpers from 6 to 0. Corpus-wide
        figures belong in the review writeup, measured, not here: the first
        draft of this docstring quoted 3,113 -> 267 and 460 -> 3,366, and
        those two scans had counted with different needles.

        Program-wide evidence restores that coverage. Two cheaper sources
        were tried first and rejected on measurement:
          * the helper's callee -- the stubs funnel into unnamed native
            plumbing, and one sink is shared by five unregistered helpers
            and thirty-six registered managed methods, so it would
            re-admit AsyncTaskMethodBuilder.SetException, the exact defect
            fix 90 removed;
          * a linear window at each pad instead of real blocks -- 0.6s,
            but it inverted role dominance for 0x1804356b0 (truly 283
            rethrow / 24 raise, approximated as 617 / 1829), which would
            emit `throw x;` where `throw;` belongs.

        So this runs the real shape detection over every pad-bearing
        method (1.7s for 4,526 here) and keeps only targets _eh_helper_ok
        already accepts -- which now also rejects runtime plumbing the
        lifter can already name, and any routine with a reachable `ret` --
        and then only where at least _EH_HELPER_MIN_WITNESSES independent
        methods agree, by a margin of _EH_HELPER_MIN_DOMINANCE. Here that
        proves exactly two: 0x180435740 rethrow (3403 witnesses vs 126) and
        0x180435670 raise (183 vs 25). An earlier draft trusted the witness
        count alone and published six, three of which were runtime plumbing
        and one of which simply returns. -- fix 91
