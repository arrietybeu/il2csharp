"""Regression tests for fix 91: the program-wide proven throw-helper set.

Fix 90 established that helper naming must be per-method evidence. That was
correct but narrow: a method with no EH pad of its own can never name a
helper, so throw renderings collapsed and bare `sub_...` calls took their
place. Fix 91 proves the helpers once, from the whole binary.

The first draft of fix 91 trusted witness counts alone and published six
targets. Four of them were wrong, and my own probe caught it:

  * 0x180435420 is a `jmp` thunk onto il2cpp_codegen_initialize_runtime_metadata.
    181 methods taught it as "the rethrow helper", so every
    `il2cpp_codegen_initialize_runtime_metadata(typeof(...))` line in them was
    replaced by a bare `throw;`, which also cascaded into the following
    allocation and renumbered the locals.
  * 0x1804356a0 and 0x1804356b0 are raise_IndexOutOfRangeException and
    raise_NullReferenceException. Both really are throw helpers, but each
    raises one specific new exception and already carries a name derived from
    a string reference in its own wrapper chain, so flattening them to a bare
    `throw;` loses which exception is thrown.
  * 0x180002650 was taught by 45 pad-bearing methods, yet its body is
    `movsxd rdx,[rcx+10h]; ...; ret`. A throw helper never returns; the pad
    scan only reached it because the real helper ahead of it was skipped.

So the gate now also rejects plumbing the lifter can already name (directly
or through a thunk chain) and any routine with a reachable `ret`, and the set
keeps a target only where many independent methods agree on it by a decisive
role margin. Both new filters are properties of the callee alone, so they
screen the per-method evidence and the program-wide set alike.
